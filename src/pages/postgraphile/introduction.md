<p class='intro'>
PostGraphile (formerly PostGraphQL) builds a powerful, extensible and
performant GraphQL API from a PostgreSQL schema in seconds; saving you
weeks if not months of development time.
</p>

If you already use PostgreSQL then you understand the value that a strongly
typed and well defined schema can bring to application development; GraphQL is
the perfect match for this technology when it comes to making your data layer
accessible to your frontend application developers (or even API clients). Why
duplicate your authorization and business logic in a custom API when you can
leverage the tried and tested capabilities built into
[the worlds most advanced open source database](https://www.postgresql.org/)?

_If you are new to GraphQL then we recommend you read through the official
introduction to GraphQL [here](https://graphql.org/learn/) before continuing
through the PostGraphile documentation._

By combining powerful features such as PostgreSQL's
[role-based grant system](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/user-manag.html)
and
[row-level security policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-rowsecurity.html)
with Graphile Engine's advanced
[GraphQL look-ahead](/graphile-build/look-ahead/) and
[plugin expansion](/graphile-build/plugins/) technologies, PostGraphile ensures
your generated schema is secure, performant and extensible.

Some of the features we offer:

- [Incredible performance](/postgraphile/performance/) - no N+1 query issues
- Extensibility via [schema](/postgraphile/extending/) and
  [server](/postgraphile/plugins/) plugins
- [Auto-discovered relations](/postgraphile/relations/) e.g. `userByAuthorId`
- [Computed columns](/postgraphile/computed-columns/) allowing easy expansion of
  your API
- [Custom query procedures](/postgraphile/custom-queries/) enabling arbitrary
  SQL queries
- [Automatic CRUD mutations](/postgraphile/crud-mutations/) e.g. `updatePost`
- [Custom mutation procedures](/postgraphile/custom-mutations/) enabling complex
  changes to be exposed simply
- [Real-time](/postgraphile/realtime/) features powered by LISTEN/NOTIFY and/or
  logical decoding

The easiest way to get started is with the
[CLI interface](/postgraphile/usage-cli/); if you have `npx` installed you can
try it out with:

```
npx postgraphile -c postgres://user:pass@localhost/mydb --watch --enhance-graphiql --dynamic-json
```

(replacing user, pass and mydb with your PostgreSQL username, password and the
name of your database)
